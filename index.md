## Have Some Fun

Hey.. There. It's ME. *Name toh upar dekha hoga.* What can I do for YOU? or for ME? Technically it's NOTHING... Humans are self+ish(oriented). But,

All leaders/politicians are not wrong. So,

```yaml
KEEP LEARNING... KEEP LEARNING... KEEP LEARNING...
```

Once you started to learn, You start to IMAGINE. Now, 

```yaml
KEEP IMAGINING... KEEP IMAGINING... KEEP IMAGINING...
```

Once the World started to accept your frequencies. The MAGIC will happen. Till then,

```yaml
KEEP BELIEVING... KEEP LISTINING... KEEP BELIEVING... KEEP LISTINING...   
```
    
<script>
const toggleDarkMode = document.querySelector('.js-toggle-dark-mode');

    var allcookies = document.cookie;
    cookiearray = allcookies.split(';');
    for(var i=0; i<cookiearray.length; i++) {
        var name = cookiearray[i].split('=')[0];
        var value = cookiearray[i].split('=')[1];
        if(name.trim() == 'theme'){
            if(value.trim() == "dark"){
                toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Light Theme';
            }else{
                toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Dark Theme';
            }
            break;
        }
    }

jtd.addEvent(toggleDarkMode, 'click', function(){
  if (jtd.getTheme() === 'dark') {
    jtd.setTheme('light');
    document.cookie = 'theme=' + 'light';
    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Dark Theme';
  } else {
    jtd.setTheme('dark');
    document.cookie = 'theme=' + 'dark';
    toggleDarkMode.textContent = 'Light Theme';
  }
});
</script>

### And finally stay `HAPPY`, and Have `SOME MORE FUN`.   Because,

```yaml
The Circle will be maintained! You cant't Escape it. The Only Answer GOD Knows OR made by someone. 
```

## Now, take a Deep Breath. Sometimes we forget to do this.
