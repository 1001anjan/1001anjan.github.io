# Composition, Aggregation, and Association
In Java design, composition, aggregation, and association are three different relationships between classes that define how objects interact with each other. These relationships play a crucial role in designing the structure and behavior of an application. Let's explore each one in more detail:

### Composition:
Composition represents a strong "has-a" relationship between two classes, where the existence of one class is dependent on the other. In composition, the child class cannot exist independently of the parent class. If the parent object is destroyed, the child object is also destroyed. The child class is an integral part of the parent class and cannot be reused elsewhere.

Example:
```java
class Car {
   private Engine engine;

   public Car() {
      engine = new Engine();
   }
}
```
In this example, the Car class has a composition relationship with the Engine class. The Car class creates an instance of the Engine class in its constructor, indicating that an engine is an essential part of a car.

### Aggregation:
Aggregation represents a "has-a" relationship between two classes, but the child class can exist independently of the parent class. It is a weaker relationship compared to composition. In aggregation, the child class can be shared among multiple parent classes. When the parent object is destroyed, the child object can still exist.

Example:
```java
class Department {
   private List<Employee> employees;

   public Department() {
      employees = new ArrayList<>();
   }
}
```
In this example, the Department class has an aggregation relationship with the Employee class. The Department class contains a list of employees, but the employees can exist independently and can be associated with multiple departments.

### Association:
Association represents a relationship between two classes, indicating that objects of one class are connected to objects of another class. It is a looser relationship compared to composition and aggregation. Unlike composition and aggregation, association does not imply ownership or dependence.

Example:
```java
class Student {
   private List<Course> courses;
}
```

In this example, the Student class has an association with the Course class. The Student class can have a list of courses, but the courses can exist independently, and they are not an integral part of the Student class.

It's important to note that these relationships are conceptual and can be implemented using appropriate class member variables and methods in Java. The choice of composition, aggregation, or association depends on the desired behavior and the nature of the relationship between the classes.
