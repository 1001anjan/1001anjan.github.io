<p>You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.</p>

<p>Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).</p>

<p>The island doesnâ€™t have â€œlakesâ€, meaning the water inside isnâ€™t connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height donâ€™t exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.</p>
