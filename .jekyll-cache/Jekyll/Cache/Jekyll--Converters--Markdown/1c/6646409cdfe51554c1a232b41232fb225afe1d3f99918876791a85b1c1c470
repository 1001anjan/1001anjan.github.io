<p>Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.</p>

<div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 9 after calling your function.
</code></pre></div></div>
