# Surrounded Regions
Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that are 4-directionally surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

##### Example 1:
![](../../assets/images/ds/xogrid.jpeg)
```markdown
Input: board = [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Output: [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
- It is on the border, or
- It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
  The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
  The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
```
##### Example 2:
```markdown
Input: board = [["X"]]
Output: [["X"]]
```
##### Constraints:
* m == board.length
* n == board[i].length
* 1 <= m, n <= 200
* board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.

### Solution:
