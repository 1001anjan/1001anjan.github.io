# Largest Divisible Subset
Given a set of distinct positive integers nums, return the largest subset answer such that every pair (answer[i], answer[j]) of elements in this subset satisfies:

* answer[i] % answer[j] == 0, or
* answer[j] % answer[i] == 0
If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

##### Example 1:
```markdown
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: [1,3] is also accepted.
```
##### Example 2:
```markdown
Input: nums = [1,2,4,8]
Output: [1,2,4,8]
```
##### Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
* 1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^9
* All the integers in nums are unique.

### Solution:
```java

```
