### DataBase Session and Connection
Generally, executing multiple SQL queries in a single session can improve performance by reducing the overhead of establishing and tearing down multiple database connections.

However, in some cases, it may be beneficial to use multiple sessions, for example, when there is a need to isolate transactions and ensure data consistency, or when there are concurrent requests that need to access the database simultaneously.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use a single session or multiple sessions should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of your application and the underlying database management system.

### Handle concurrent request of using database session
Handling concurrent requests in a database session requires proper synchronization and management of the database sessions to prevent race conditions, deadlocks, and other concurrency-related issues. Here are some common approaches to handle concurrent requests:

* Locking: This involves locking the relevant rows, tables, or the entire database to prevent concurrent access. However, locking can lead to reduced performance and the possibility of deadlocks.

* Transactions: Transactions allow you to group multiple SQL statements into a single, atomic unit of work. When a transaction is committed, all changes are made permanent, and when a transaction is rolled back, all changes are discarded.

* Connection Pooling: Connection pooling is a technique where a pool of database connections is maintained, and connections are reused as needed. This reduces the overhead of creating and destroying database connections for each request.

* Optimistic Locking: Optimistic locking is a concurrency control technique that assumes that multiple transactions can complete without affecting each other. Conflicts are detected at commit time and resolved by restarting the transaction.

These are just a few of the techniques used to handle concurrent requests in a database session. The specific approach that's best for your application will depend on the type and volume of concurrent requests, the underlying database management system, and other constraints.

### How to handle concurrent request required to access database in springboot

In Spring Boot, you can handle concurrent database access requests by using either of the following methods:

* Pessimistic locking: In this approach, a lock is acquired on the database record that you are accessing, and other threads have to wait until the lock is released. You can use the @Transactional annotation and set the isolation property to Isolation.SERIALIZABLE to enable pessimistic locking in Spring Boot.

* Optimistic locking: In this approach, multiple threads can access the database record simultaneously, but if two or more threads try to update the same record at the same time, one of them will fail, and you will have to handle the failure gracefully. You can enable optimistic locking in Spring Boot by using the @Version annotation on the version field in your entity class and using the saveAndFlush() method to update the record.

It is also recommended to use a database connection pool to manage the database connections effectively and avoid connection exhaustion. Spring Boot provides built-in support for HikariCP, which is a high-performance connection pool.

### Here is a complete example of handling concurrent database access requests using JPA in Spring Boot:
```java
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;

    private String name;

    @Version
    private Integer version;

    // getters and setters
}

@Repository
public interface UserRepository extends JpaRepository<User, Integer> {

}

@Service
public class UserService {

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    @Transactional
    public void updateUser(Integer id, String name) {
        User user = userRepository.findById(id).orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("User not found"));
        user.setName(name);
        try {
            userRepository.saveAndFlush(user);
        } catch (OptimisticLockingFailureException e) {
            // handle optimistic locking failure
        }
    }
}

@SpringBootApplication
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
    }

}
```
In the example above, we have defined an `User` entity class, a `UserRepository` interface that extends the `JpaRepository` interface provided by Spring Data JPA, and a `UserService` class that performs the database operations. The `UserService` class is annotated with the `@Transactional` annotation to enable transaction management. The updateUser method performs the update operation on the user record and handles the optimistic locking failure, if any, using the `OptimisticLockingFailureException` exception. The Application class is the main class that starts the Spring Boot application.

This is just a basic example to give you an idea of how you can handle concurrent database access requests using JPA in Spring Boot. You can customize the example as per your needs and requirements.

### Example using connection pooling
Here is an example of how you can configure connection pooling in Spring Boot using the HikariCP library:

1. First, add the following dependency in your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.zaxxer</groupId>
    <artifactId>HikariCP</artifactId>
    <version>3.4.5</version>
</dependency>
```
Next, add the following configuration in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:
```yaml
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test
spring.datasource.username=user
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size=5
spring.datasource.hikari.idle-timeout=30000
```
This configuration sets the maximum pool size to 5 and the idle timeout to 30 seconds. You can adjust these values as per your needs and requirements.

Finally, make sure to use the DataSource bean provided by Spring Boot instead of creating your own. Spring Boot automatically configures the DataSource bean to use the HikariCP library.
That's it. You have successfully configured connection pooling in Spring Boot using the `HikariCP` library. You can now use the DataSource bean in your code to access the database and handle concurrent database access requests.

### dataSource bean with example
A `DataSource` bean is a Java object that represents a database connection pool and is used to manage database connections in a Java application. In Spring Boot, you can define a `DataSource` bean using the `DataSourceBuilder` class provided by Spring.

Here is an example of how you can define a DataSource bean in Spring Boot:
```java
@Configuration
public class DataSourceConfig {

    @Bean
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.datasource")
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build();
    }

}
```
In the example above, the `DataSourceConfig` class is annotated with the `@Configuration` annotation, indicating that it is a configuration class. The `dataSource` method is annotated with the `@Bean` annotation, indicating that it is a bean method. The `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation is used to bind the properties in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file with the DataSource bean. The `prefix` attribute of the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation is set to `"spring.datasource"`, which specifies that only the properties that start with `"spring.datasource"` should be bound to the `DataSource` bean.

The `dataSource` method creates a `DataSource` object using the `DataSourceBuilder` class and returns it. The build method of the `DataSourceBuilder` class is called to build the `DataSource` object.

This is just a basic example to give you an idea of how you can define a `DataSource` bean in Spring Boot. You can customize the example as per your needs and requirements. For example, you can specify the type of the `DataSource` bean, configure the connection pool properties, and so on.

### Handle concurrent request using iBatis
iBATIS is an SQL Mapping framework for Java, .NET, and other platforms. To handle concurrent requests in iBATIS, you can use connection pooling to manage a pool of database connections and ensure that each request is executed on a separate, dedicated connection. This way, each request is executed in isolation, avoiding any concurrency issues.

Here's an example of how you can configure connection pooling in iBATIS for a Java application:

* Create a data source for the database connection pool using a library such as Apache Commons DBCP.

* Configure the iBATIS SqlMapConfig.xml file to use the data source.

```xml
<dataSources>
  <dataSource type="SIMPLE">
    <property name="JDBC.Driver" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
    <property name="JDBC.ConnectionURL" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost/test"/>
    <property name="JDBC.Username" value="username"/>
    <property name="JDBC.Password" value="password"/>
  </dataSource>
</dataSources>
```
In your Java code, use the SqlMapClient instance to execute SQL statements. The SqlMapClient instance will automatically use a connection from the connection pool to execute the statement.

```java
SqlMapClient sqlMap = SqlMapClientBuilder.buildSqlMapClient(reader);
sqlMap.queryForList("getUsers");
```
This is just a simple example of how you can handle concurrent requests in iBATIS using connection pooling. You may need to make additional configurations and optimizations depending on your specific use case.

### SpringBoot Example:
Here's an example of how you can handle concurrent requests in a Spring Boot application using iBATIS and connection pooling:

1. Add the iBATIS and connection pooling dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.mybatis</groupId>
  <artifactId>mybatis</artifactId>
  <version>3.5.5</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
  <artifactId>commons-dbcp2</artifactId>
  <version>2.8.0</version>
</dependency>
```
2. Create a configuration class to configure the data source and iBATIS 
SqlSessionFactory:
```java
@Configuration
public class MyBatisConfig {

  @Bean
  public DataSource dataSource() {
    BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
    dataSource.setDriverClassName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
    dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test");
    dataSource.setUsername("username");
    dataSource.setPassword("password");
    dataSource.setInitialSize(5);
    dataSource.setMaxTotal(10);
    return dataSource;
  }

  @Bean
  public SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory(DataSource dataSource) throws Exception {
    SqlSessionFactoryBean sessionFactory = new SqlSessionFactoryBean();
    sessionFactory.setDataSource(dataSource);
    return sessionFactory.getObject();
  }
}
```
3. Create a repository class to interact with the database using iBATIS:
```java
@Repository
public class UserRepository {

  private final SqlSession sqlSession;

  @Autowired
  public UserRepository(SqlSession sqlSession) {
    this.sqlSession = sqlSession;
  }

  public List<User> findAll() {
    return sqlSession.selectList("findAllUsers");
  }
}
```
4. Create a service class to handle the business logic:

```java
@Service
public class UserService {

  private final UserRepository userRepository;

  @Autowired
  public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
    this.userRepository = userRepository;
  }

  public List<User> findAll() {
    return userRepository.findAll();
  }
}
```
5. Finally, create a controller to handle HTTP requests:
```java
@RestController
public class UserController {

  private final UserService userService;

  @Autowired
  public UserController(UserService userService) {
    this.userService = userService;
  }

  @GetMapping("/users")
  public List<User> findAll() {
    return userService.findAll();
  }
}
```
With this setup, each HTTP request will be executed in a separate iBATIS SqlSession, ensuring that each request is executed in isolation and avoiding any concurrency issues. The connection pool will manage a pool of database connections and ensure that each request is executed on

Here's how you can define connection pooling in the above example code:

1. In the `MyBatisConfig` class, create a `DataSource` bean using Apache Commons DBCP's `BasicDataSource` class:
```java
@Bean
public DataSource dataSource() {
    BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
    dataSource.setDriverClassName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
    dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test");
    dataSource.setUsername("username");
    dataSource.setPassword("password");
    dataSource.setInitialSize(5);
    dataSource.setMaxTotal(10);
    return dataSource;
}
```
2. In the same `MyBatisConfig` class, use the `DataSource` bean to create a `SqlSessionFactory` bean:
```java
@Bean
public SqlSessionFactory sqlSessionFactory(DataSource dataSource) throws Exception {
  SqlSessionFactoryBean sessionFactory = new SqlSessionFactoryBean();
  sessionFactory.setDataSource(dataSource);
  return sessionFactory.getObject();
}
```

With these changes, the `DataSource` bean will be used to create the `SqlSessionFactory` bean, and the `SqlSessionFactory` bean will be used to create the `SqlSession` instances in the `UserRepository` class. The `BasicDataSource` class will manage the connection pool and ensure that each request is executed on a separate, dedicated connection.
