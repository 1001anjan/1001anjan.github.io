# Prometheus
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for modern software environments. It was initially developed at SoundCloud and has since become a prominent project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Prometheus is widely used in the field of DevOps and system monitoring for its ability to collect, store, and query metrics from various sources. Here are some key features and components of Prometheus:
1. Data Collection: Prometheus can collect metrics from a wide range of sources, including applications, services, and infrastructure components. It supports various protocols for data ingestion, including HTTP, SNMP, and more.
2. Time-Series Database: Prometheus stores collected metrics as time-series data. Each metric is associated with a timestamp, allowing for historical analysis and trend monitoring.
3. Flexible Query Language: Prometheus Query Language (PromQL) enables users to write expressive queries to extract and manipulate metrics data. This is valuable for creating custom alerts, dashboards, and reports.
4. Alerting: Prometheus has a built-in alerting system that allows you to define rules and conditions for triggering alerts based on metric values. It can send notifications through various channels like email, Slack, or other alerting systems.
5. Scalability: Prometheus is designed to be highly scalable and can handle large volumes of data and high-frequency scraping of metrics from targets.
6. Service Discovery: It supports service discovery mechanisms, allowing it to dynamically discover and monitor new instances of services as they come online or go offline.
7. Data Export: Prometheus provides APIs and integrations to export data to other systems, making it compatible with various visualization and alerting tools like Grafana.
8. Extensibility: The Prometheus ecosystem includes a rich set of exporters and integrations for monitoring popular services, databases, and cloud platforms. Additionally, users can develop custom exporters to monitor specific applications or systems.

Prometheus is a foundational component of the cloud-native and containerized application monitoring stack. It is often used alongside other tools like Grafana for visualization and alerting, creating a comprehensive observability solution for modern software architectures.
