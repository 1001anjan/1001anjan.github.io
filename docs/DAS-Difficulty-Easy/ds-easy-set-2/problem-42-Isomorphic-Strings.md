# Isomorphic Strings

Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

##### Example 1:
```markdown
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

##### Example 2:
```markdown
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```
##### Example 3:
```markdown
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```
### Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
* t.length == s.length
* s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
