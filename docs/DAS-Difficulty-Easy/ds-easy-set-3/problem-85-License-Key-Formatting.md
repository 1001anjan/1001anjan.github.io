# License Key Formatting

You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.

We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.

##### Example 1:
```markdown
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```
##### Example 2:
```markdown
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```
##### Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 105
* s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
* 1 <= k <= 104

### Solution
```java
class Solution {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int count = 0;
        for(int i = s.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
            if(s.charAt(i) != '-'){
                if(count == k){
                    count = 0;
                    sb = sb.append("-");
                }
                sb = sb.append(Character.toUpperCase(s.charAt(i)));
                count++;
            }
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```
