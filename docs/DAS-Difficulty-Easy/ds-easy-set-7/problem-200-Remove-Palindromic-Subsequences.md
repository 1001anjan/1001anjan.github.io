# Remove Palindromic Subsequences

You are given a string s consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b'. In a single step you can remove one palindromic subsequence from s.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A string is a subsequence of a given string if it is generated by deleting some characters of a given string without changing its order. Note that a subsequence does not necessarily need to be contiguous.

A string is called palindrome if is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

##### Example 1:
```markdown
Input: s = "ababa"
Output: 1
Explanation: s is already a palindrome, so its entirety can be removed in a single step.
```
##### Example 2:
```markdown
Input: s = "abb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "abb" -> "bb" -> "".
Remove palindromic subsequence "a" then "bb".
```
##### Example 3:
```markdown
Input: s = "baabb"
Output: 2
Explanation: "baabb" -> "b" -> "".
Remove palindromic subsequence "baab" then "b".
```
##### Constraints:
* 1 <= s.length <= 1000
* s[i] is either 'a' or 'b'.

### Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        sb.append(s);
        sb.reverse();
        return sb.toString().equals(s) ? 1 : 2;
    }
}
```
