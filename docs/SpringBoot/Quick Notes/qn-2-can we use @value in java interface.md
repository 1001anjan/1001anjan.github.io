# Can we use @value in java interface?

No, you cannot use the `@Value` annotation in a Java interface. The `@Value` annotation is used to inject a property value into a field, constructor or setter method, and it can only be used on a class or bean. Since an interface is not a class or bean, it cannot be used to hold state, therefore it is not possible to use `@Value` annotation on interface.

It's worth noting that interfaces in Java do not have any implementation, they only define method signatures. And Spring uses @Value annotation to set the value of a field in a specific instance of a class, which is not possible for interfaces.

If you want to share some properties across multiple classes, you can use the `@ConfigurationProperties` annotation on a class and autowire it in other classes.

Alternatively, you can use `Environment` object to access the property values, or use `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` for `XML` based configuration.
