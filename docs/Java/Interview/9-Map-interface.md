### TreeMap and HashMap

1. HashMap and TreeMap are both implementations of the Map interface in Java, but they have some key differences:

2. Ordering: HashMap does not guarantee any particular order of its elements. The elements are stored in an unordered manner based on the hash code of the keys. On the other hand, TreeMap maintains its elements in sorted order based on the natural ordering of the keys or a custom Comparator provided during initialization.

3. Performance: HashMap provides constant-time performance (O(1)) for basic operations like get() and put(), assuming a good hash function and proper load factor. In contrast, TreeMap provides logarithmic-time performance (O(log n)) for basic operations due to the underlying red-black tree structure used for sorting.

4. Sorting: As mentioned earlier, TreeMap sorts its elements based on the keys. This makes it useful when you need a sorted map based on natural ordering or a custom Comparator. HashMap does not have any built-in sorting capability.

5. Null Keys: HashMap allows a single null key and multiple null values. On the other hand, TreeMap does not allow null keys but can have multiple null values.

6. Iteration: HashMap provides faster iteration since it does not have to maintain any specific order. TreeMap, being sorted, provides iteration in the sorted order of keys.

7. Memory Overhead: TreeMap generally requires more memory compared to HashMap because it needs to maintain the additional tree structure for sorting.

8. Use Cases: HashMap is typically used when you require fast lookups and do not care about the order of elements. TreeMap is suitable when you need to maintain a sorted map or perform range-based operations, such as finding the nearest key or values within a certain range.
